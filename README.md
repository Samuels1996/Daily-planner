# Daily-planner
This project was a daily planner using HTML, CSS, JS, as well as moment. Plan your day and give it a shot!


In this project we were tasked with creating a daily planner utilizing the upper tools to make an efficient and pretty site. 

The site is designed to follow time based on your local timezone for the machine that you are using and allow you to save daily tasks.

The site offers color changing background for each time slot depending on if the time has passed, is coming, or if you are currently in that hour.
